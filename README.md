[Semantic Definition Format (SDF) for Data and Interactions of Things](https://ietf-wg-asdf.github.io/SDF/sdf.html)

The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts to use in
the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models that describe Things,
i.e., physical objects that are available for interaction over a network.
An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects/SDF Things and their
associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the Data types
for the information exchanged in those interactions.
